version 1.0.16   released on 13 Dec 2017, origin: https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.16.tar.gz

Steps to get the headers on linux:
$ ./configure
take those from libsodium-<version>/src/libsodium/include

(when comparatively installing an Ubuntu/debian libsodium-dev package, the directory sodium/private/ and file sodium/randombytes_nativeclient.h
don't exist !
Therefore:
sodium/private/ is considered to be not part of the (public) API and got excluded in the D-binding.
sodium/randombytes_nativeclient.h has to be dealt with specifically.
)

Translating to D:
sodium.h will be package.d within directory sodium


excerpt of changelog:


* Version 1.0.16
 - Signatures computations and verifications are now way faster on
64-bit platforms with compilers supporting 128-bit arithmetic (gcc,
clang, icc). This includes the WebAssembly target.
 - New low-level APIs for computations over edwards25519:
`crypto_scalarmult_ed25519()`, `crypto_scalarmult_ed25519_base()`,
`crypto_core_ed25519_is_valid_point()`, `crypto_core_ed25519_add()`,
`crypto_core_ed25519_sub()` and `crypto_core_ed25519_from_uniform()`
(elligator representative to point).
 - `crypto_sign_open()`, `crypto_sign_verify_detached() and
`crypto_sign_edwards25519sha512batch_open` now reject public keys in
non-canonical form in addition to low-order points.
 - The library can be built with `ED25519_NONDETERMINISTIC` defined in
order to use synthetic nonces for EdDSA. This is disabled by default.
 - Webassembly: `crypto_pwhash_*()` functions are now included in
non-sumo builds.
 - `sodium_stackzero()` was added to wipe content off the stack.
 - Android: support new SDKs where unified headers have become the
default.
 - The Salsa20-based PRNG example is now thread-safe on platforms with
support for thread-local storage, optionally mixes bits from RDRAND.
 - CMAKE: static library detection on Unix systems has been improved
(thanks to @BurningEnlightenment, @nibua-r, @mellery451)
 - Argon2 and scrypt are slightly faster on Linux.

* Version 1.0.15
 - The default password hashing algorithm is now Argon2id. The
`pwhash_str_verify()` function can still verify Argon2i hashes
without any changes, and `pwhash()` can still compute Argon2i hashes
as well.
 - The aes128ctr primitive was removed. It was slow, non-standard, not
authenticated, and didn't seem to be used by any opensource project.
 - Argon2id required at least 3 passes like Argon2i, despite a minimum
of `1` as defined by the `OPSLIMIT_MIN` constant. This has been fixed.
 - The secretstream construction was slightly changed to be consistent
with forthcoming variants.
 - The Javascript and Webassembly versions have been merged, and the
module now returns a `.ready` promise that will resolve after the
Webassembly code is loaded and compiled.
 - Note that due to these incompatible changes, the library version
major was bumped up.

* Version 1.0.14
 - iOS binaries should now be compatible with WatchOS and TVOS.
 - WebAssembly is now officially supported. Special thanks to
@facekapow and @pepyakin who helped to make it happen.
 - Internal consistency checks failing and primitives used with
dangerous/out-of-bounds/invalid parameters used to call abort(3).
Now, a custom handler *that doesn't return* can be set with the
`set_sodium_misuse()` function. It still aborts by default or if the
handler ever returns. This is not a replacement for non-fatal,
expected runtime errors. This handler will be only called in
unexpected situations due to potential bugs in the library or in
language bindings.
 - `*_MESSAGEBYTES_MAX` macros (and the corresponding
`_messagebytes_max()` symbols) have been added to represent the
maximum message size that can be safely handled by a primitive.
Language bindings are encouraged to check user inputs against these
maximum lengths.
 - The test suite has been extended to cover more edge cases.
 - crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519() now rejects points that are
not on the curve, or not in the main subgroup.
 - Further changes have been made to ensure that smart compilers will
not optimize out code that we don't want to be optimized.
 - Visual Studio solutions are now included in distribution tarballs.
 - The `sodium_runtime_has_*` symbols for CPU features detection are
now defined as weak symbols, i.e. they can be replaced with an
application-defined implementation. This can be useful to disable
AVX* when temperature/power consumption is a concern.
 - `crypto_kx_*()` now aborts if called with no non-NULL pointers to
store keys to.
 - SSE2 implementations of `crypto_verify_*()` have been added.
 - Passwords can be hashed using a specific algorithm with the new
`crypto_pwhash_str_alg()` function.
 - Due to popular demand, base64 encoding (`sodium_bin2base64()`) and
decoding (`sodium_base642bin()`) have been implemented.
 - A new `crypto_secretstream_*()` API was added to safely encrypt files
and multi-part messages.
 - The `sodium_pad()` and `sodium_unpad()` helper functions have been
added in order to add & remove padding.
 - An AVX512 optimized implementation of Argon2 has been added (written
by Ondrej Mosnáček, thanks!)
 - The `crypto_pwhash_str_needs_rehash()` function was added to check if
a password hash string matches the given parameters, or if it needs an
update.
 - The library can now be compiled with recent versions of
emscripten/binaryen that don't allow multiple variables declarations
using a single `var` statement.

* Version 1.0.13
 - Javascript: the sumo builds now include all symbols. They were
previously limited to symbols defined in minimal builds.
 - The public `crypto_pwhash_argon2i_MEMLIMIT_MAX` constant was
incorrectly defined on 32-bit platforms. This has been fixed.
 - Version 1.0.12 didn't compile on OpenBSD/i386 using the base gcc
compiler. This has been fixed.
 - The Android compilation scripts have been updated for NDK r14b.
 - armv7s-optimized code was re-added to iOS builds.
 - An AVX2 optimized implementation of the Argon2 round function was
added.
 - The Argon2id variant of Argon2 has been implemented. The
high-level `crypto_pwhash_str_verify()` function automatically detects
the algorithm and can verify both Argon2i and Argon2id hashed passwords.
The default algorithm for newly hashed passwords remains Argon2i in
this version to avoid breaking compatibility with verifiers running
libsodium <= 1.0.12.
 - A `crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305_seal*()` function set was
implemented.
 - scrypt was removed from minimal builds.
 - libsodium is now available on NuGet.

* Version 1.0.12
 - Ed25519ph was implemented, adding a multi-part signature API
(`crypto_sign_init()`, `crypto_sign_update()`, `crypto_sign_final_*()`).
 - New constants and related accessors have been added for Scrypt and
Argon2.
 - XChaCha20 has been implemented. Like XSalsa20, this construction
extends the ChaCha20 cipher to accept a 192-bit nonce. This makes it safe
to use ChaCha20 with random nonces.
 - `crypto_secretbox`, `crypto_box` and `crypto_aead` now offer
variants leveraging XChaCha20.
 - SHA-2 is about 20% faster, which also gives a speed boost to
signature and signature verification.
 - AVX2 implementations of Salsa20 and ChaCha20 have been added. They
are twice as fast as the SSE2 implementations. The speed gain is
even more significant on Windows, that previously didn't use
vectorized implementations.
 - New high-level API: `crypto_kdf`, to easily derive one or more
subkeys from a master key.
 - Siphash with a 128-bit output has been implemented, and is
available as `crypto_shorthash_siphashx_*`.
 - New `*_keygen()` helpers functions have been added to create secret
keys for all constructions. This improves code clarity and can prevent keys
from being partially initialized.
 - A new `randombytes_buf_deterministic()` function was added to
deterministically fill a memory region with pseudorandom data. This
function can especially be useful to write reproducible tests.
 - A preliminary `crypto_kx_*()` API was added to compute shared session
keys.
 - AVX2 detection is more reliable.
 - The pthreads library is not required any more when using MingW.
 - `contrib/Findsodium.cmake` was added as an example to include
libsodium in a project using cmake.
 - Compatibility with gcc 2.x has been restored.
 - Minimal builds can be checked using `sodium_library_minimal()`.
 - The `--enable-opt` compilation switch has become compatible with more
platforms.
 - Android builds are now using clang on platforms where it is
available.

* Version 1.0.11
 - sodium_init() is now thread-safe, and can be safely called multiple
times.
 - Android binaries now properly support 64-bit Android, targeting
platform 24, but without breaking compatibility with platforms 16 and
21.
 - Better support for old gcc versions.
 - On FreeBSD, core dumps are disabled on regions allocated with
sodium allocation functions.
 - AVX2 detection was fixed, resulting in faster Blake2b hashing on
platforms where it was not properly detected.
 - The Sandy2x Curve25519 implementation was not as fast as expected
on some platforms. This has been fixed.
 - The NativeClient target was improved. Most notably, it now supports
optimized implementations, and uses pepper_49 by default.
 - The library can be compiled with recent Emscripten versions.
Changes have been made to produce smaller code, and the default heap
size was reduced in the standard version.
 - The code can now be compiled on SLES11 service pack 4.
 - Decryption functions can now accept a NULL pointer for the output.
This checks the MAC without writing the decrypted message.
 - crypto_generichash_final() now returns -1 if called twice.
 - Support for Visual Studio 2008 was improved.

* Version 1.0.10
 - This release only fixes a compilation issue reported with some older
gcc versions. There are no functional changes over the previous release.

* Version 1.0.9
 - The Javascript target now includes a `--sumo` option to include all the symbols of the original C library.
 - A detached API was added to the ChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES256-GCM implementations.
 - The Argon2i password hashing function was added, and is accessible
directly and through a new, high-level `crypto_pwhash` API. The scrypt
function remains available as well.
 - A speed-record AVX2 implementation of BLAKE2b was added (thanks to Samuel Neves).
 - The library can now be compiled using C++Builder (thanks to @jcolli44)
 - Countermeasures for Ed25519 signatures malleability have been added
to match the irtf-cfrg-eddsa draft (note that malleability is irrelevant to
the standard definition of signature security). Signatures with a small-order
`R` point are now also rejected.
 - Some implementations are now slightly faster when using the Clang compiler.
 - The HChaCha20 core function was implemented (`crypto_core_hchacha20()`).
 - No-op stubs were added for all AES256-GCM public functions even when compiled on non-Intel platforms.
 - `crypt_generichash_blake2b_statebytes()` was added.
 - New macros were added for the IETF variant of the ChaCha20-Poly1305 construction.
 - The library can now be compiled on Minix.
 - HEASLR is now enabled on MinGW builds.

* Version 1.0.8
 - Handle the case where the CPU supports AVX, but we are running on an hypervisor with AVX disabled/not supported.
 - Faster (2x) scalarmult_base() when using the ref10 implementation.
