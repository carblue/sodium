General Note:
While I'm not a fan of deploying binaries, I do this here for testing puposes and lazy users,
though I recommend to get Your own copies from https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/ or build from source.


This folder has to be populated at least with file libsodium.lib (COFF format for -m64, 64 bit) (import library or static lib).


At Your option (if You opted for the import library) place the .dll here as well (or within %PATH%), and dub.json (copyFiles-windows-*)
will copy the .dll to directory 'targetPath' (in turn for possibly different Windows builds), thus this ensures, that always the
matching pair of import lib and .dll is used.

The files included are from https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.14-msvc.zip,
folder ...\libsodium-1.0.14-msvc\x64\Release\v140\dynamic  (Visual Studio 2015)
