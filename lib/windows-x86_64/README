This folder has to be populated with file libsodium.lib (COFF format) (import library or static lib):

https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/

E.g. libsodium.lib and libsodium.dll file from:
https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.12-msvc.zip

e.g. folder ...\libsodium-1.0.12-msvc\x64\Release\v140\dynamic (Visual Studio 2015)
e.g. folder ...\libsodium-1.0.12-msvc\x64\Release\v141\dynamic (Visual Studio 2017)

The file included is the import library from ...libsodium-1.0.12-msvc\x64\Release\v140\dynamic

I recommend to replace it by Your own download, as You will require either the .dll or static lib anyway
