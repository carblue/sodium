General Note:
While I'm not a fan of deploying binaries, I do this here for AppVeyor testing purposes and lazy users,
though I recommend to get Your own copies from https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/ or build from source.

Preferably select the latest stable version (see https://download.libsodium.org/doc/installation).


This folder has to be populated at least with file libsodium.lib (COFF format for -m64, 64 bit), preferrably import library (or static lib; I didn't test using a static lib).


At Your option (if You opted for the import library) place the .dll here as well (and/or within %PATH%), and dub.json (copyFiles-windows-*)
will copy the .dll to directory 'targetPath' (in turn for possibly different Windows builds), thus this ensures, that always the
matching pair of import lib and .dll is used.

The files included here are from https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.18-msvc.zip.
folder ...\libsodium\x64\Release\v140\dynamic  (Visual Studio 2015)

v90  =   Visual Studio 2008
v100 = Visual Studio 2010
v110 = Visual Studio 2012
v120 = Visual Studio 2013
v130 =   Visual Studio 14
v140 = Visual Studio 2015
v141 = Visual Studio 2017
v142 = Visual Studio 2019

AppVeyor provides these “standard” build worker images:

    Visual Studio 2013
    Visual Studio 2015   the current default
