D language: A binding to libsodium [https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium]

Version v.0.0.1: Reduced extend required so far by acos5_64 driver and secure_messaging module [https://github.com/carblue/acos5_64]

Soon to come : Full extend/complete binding to libsodium version 1.0.8, released on 25 Dec 2015.
I intend to keep this binding close to coming libsodium releases.
